## 1. Project description<a name="description"></a>

In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

## 2. Technologies<a name="tech"></a>

This system is provisioned to be built in JavaScript using React library which is highly flexible.

The browser will be in charge of rendering this application in its final form, HTML. Some of the logic involved in creating the web page, especially the one in charge of dealing with presentation logic is handled on the client-side.
